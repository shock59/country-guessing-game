# Country Guessing Games

A simple web app which gives you quizzes where you have to guess the country from a national symbol, such as flags and national anthems.

Currently available to play at [shock59.github.io/country-guessing-game](https://shock59.github.io/country-guessing-game/)!

The game is made using vanilla HTML and JavaScript. Because the game is quite simple, in the future I would like to adapt it into other formats such as a Discord bot.
